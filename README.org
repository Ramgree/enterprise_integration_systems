** Useful docker commands:
- Running a container: ~docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <some_container_name>~
  + ~-d~ = runs on the background/does not take over your terminal session
  + ~-p~ = port forwarding
- Building a container: ~docker build -t <tag_name>:<version> .~
  - ~-t~ = tag it/give it a name
  - ~.~ = where is the docker file at? . means it'll use the local folder
- Running a container with a volume: ~docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v "$PWD/<something>":/<something> <tag_name>:<version>~
  + ~"$PWD/<something>"~ = source ~<something>~ at the current folder ~($PWD)~
  + ~/<something>~ = which folder do you want to mirror the local one to, in the container?
- All docker containers *currently running*: ~docker ps~
- **Stop** a container: ~docker kill <container_id>~
  - ~<container_id>~ = you can find it from using ~docker ps~
