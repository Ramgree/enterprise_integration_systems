* Reviewer: Bruno
* Was the stated problem solved in an acceptable manner?

Yes, the front end works as expected, and it has all features of CRUD and the integration with the dependency graph.

* What has been done well and why?

The backend service interfacing was done well. It seems that they tried to retain parity with the backend tests.

* What is not well implemented and why?

The integration tests are not good, and they very heavily conflict with the functional tests, which caused me headache in order to fix them.

* How easy is it to understand?

The code was clear and self documenting.

* Recommendations to simplify

Do not install the cli. Compile everything to a binary, as it's meant to be.

* Did the implementers use anything special?

No.

* Anything else funny?

I thought it was amusing how they didn't seem to be aware that a go project can be compiled to a binary, making their lifes considerably more complicated than it should have been.
