### Issues from last homework to **not** do again

So, whenever you kids write tests, make sure that **it works on docker-compose**

How to do that?

Just write

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

You should see, at the end, "homework_two_grpc-test_1 exited with code 0" and "homework_two_repository-service-test_1 exited with code0"

If the exit codes are ANYTHING other than 0 then it ain't right, and thus, just like our dear Alex says, **transitively** we won't get points.

Ok?
